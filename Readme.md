# Transmission.

Inspired by the WAPO coronavirus transmission visualization (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/).

Made by starting from the [mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) [boid flock simulator](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples/boid_flockers) and modifying.

## How to Run

I assume you already have conda installed. Then:

1. Clone
2. CD into directory.
3. Install and activate the environment specified by `environment.yml`

* Launch the visualization
```
$ mesa runserver
```
* Visit your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8521/
* In your browser hit *run*

## NOTE:
I made this as an exploratory exercise. I've never used mesa before today.
If anyone wants to improve, please do. PRs welcome!
